    <p>  On this beautiful day, the world got lucky—you were born, and everything changed. Your smile lights up rooms, your kindness lifts hearts, and your presence makes every moment feel like a celebration. I hope today wraps you in love, laughter, and all the little joys you deserve.</p>
    
    <p>
May your dreams stretch wide like the sky, your happiness run deep like the ocean, and your year ahead sparkle with surprises, success, and sweet memories. You’re not just growing older—you’re growing more amazing.</p>
    
    <p> 
So here’s to you: to your courage, your quirks, your laughter, and your light. Keep shining, keep dreaming, and keep being unapologetically you.
Happy Birthday, with all my heart.</p>
